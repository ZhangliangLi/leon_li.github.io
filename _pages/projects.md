Truss Design Robot System Structural Design   
=======
*Designed a truss robot system with high-speed and high-precision position control using SolidWorks and ANSYS Workbench

*Performed static finite element analysis to generate cloud diagrams of the truss robot's equivalent stress and displacement

*Achieved a refined design with a truss robot system that could reach 0.5m/s running speed with positioning accuracy within 0.1mm

Fluid Dynamics in Covid-19    
=======
*Collaborated on a research project to measure the effectiveness of wearing a mask in restricting the spread of COVID-19.

*Analyzed particle motion trajectory using ANSYS platform to measure the effectiveness of wearing a mask in restricting the spread of COVID-19.

*Co-authored a published paper titled "The Effects of Whether Wearing the Mask in the Spreading Process of COVID-19."
