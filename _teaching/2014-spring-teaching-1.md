Designed a truss robot system with high-speed and high-precision position control using SolidWorks and ANSYS Workbench
======

Performed static finite element analysis to generate cloud diagrams of the truss robot's equivalent stress and displacement
======

Achieved a refined design with a truss robot system that could reach 0.5m/s running speed with positioning accuracy within 0.1mm
